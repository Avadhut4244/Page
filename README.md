## 📖 Overview
The **Landing Page** is a responsive single-page website created as part of a design-to-code workflow.  

Instead of manually coding from scratch, the project was built by:  
- Designing in **Figma**  
- Converting design → code using **Cursor AI (with Figma MCP integration)**  
- Hosting on **GitHub** and deploying via **Netlify**  

This project shows how **AI + design tools** can speed up front-end development while maintaining clean, responsive layouts.
